1. ProjectDesign - here you can find 3 images with proposed by me some things to have in test-project for current program solution and timer I run when started to work with the task
2. Employee - this one is solution folder with things like DLLs, configs, code etc.
3. To run the project I prepared, you can you CTRL+F5 buttons combination in VisualStudio which one is REST-api;
4. There are many code-libraries empty and don't contain logic required by the tecnical requirements I received before with the doc, cause I was limited by 3h.
5. Also I added 'ClientApp' with Angular base project and Employee.Auth.Token project with idea to expand this one with JWT-tokens for base Employee.API project
